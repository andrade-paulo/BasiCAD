**BasiCAD** is a simple 3D CAD program written in C++ using the Direct3D API. This system was created as the second assignment for the course Computer Graphics at the Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-√Årido.

## Features
- Creation of 3D basic shapes (cube, sphere, geosphere, cylinder, grid)
- Manipulation of the shapes (translate, rotate, scale)
- Interactable Camera
- Multiple view mode (orthographic and perspective)
- Loading objects from OBJ files

## Technologies Used
- C++
- Direct3D
- Windows API

## Build and Run Instructions
To use BasiCAD, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/andrade-paulo/BasiCAD
   ```

2. Open the solution file in Visual Studio.

3. Build the solution.

4. Run the application.

## Usage
The application will start with a grid in the center of the screen.
